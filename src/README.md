# Rustplus-PZ-Bot-PUBLIC

Unofficial quickly hacked up rustplus + discord bot. Features introduced quickly and "as needed"

Uses:
 - Rustplus javascript library [Rustplus.js](https://github.com/liamcottle/rustplus.js/commits/master)
 - Discord javascript library [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)

This is an extremely messy project, it was more of a "lab" with consistent testing and quick and hacky implementations. Little restructuring and cleaning up was done.
